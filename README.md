# [DnD Point Buy Calculator](https://flashynuff.github.io/point_buy_calculator/)

I was dissatisfied with the configurability of existing point buy calculators, so I made my own. Currently a work in progress.

You can change the values in config.js to whatever you'd like. The point costs and ability modifiers array are in order of what ability score they apply to.

Built with [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com) and [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com), as well as the [Sass version of Skeleton](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass).

Road Map:
* Support for multiple default settings!
* Export settings!
* Styling!
