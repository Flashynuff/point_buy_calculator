# [DnD Point Buy Calculator](https://flashynuff.github.io/point_buy_calculator/)

I was dissatisfied with the configurability of existing point buy calculators, so I made my own.

If you're downloading your own copy, you can edit the configs in config.js. 

Built with [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com) and [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com), as well as the [Sass version of Skeleton](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass).

Road Map:
* Export Settings
* Import Settings
* A better config structure
* Remove and add ability rows
* Remove and add point costs
